### Key Points

- It seems likely that you can build an AI agent-enabled to-do list web app using Next.js, Typescript, and Shadcn for free, deploying on Vercel with Firebase for authentication and database, and using Groq's free API for AI functionality.
- The app will feature a chatbot on the left and a to-do list on the right, with users managing tasks via natural language commands.
- Research suggests that integrating Groq's API, compatible with OpenAI's format, will handle AI tasks like adding or editing tasks based on user prompts.

### Project Overview

**What You'll Build**  
You're creating a web app where users can interact with an AI chatbot to manage a to-do list. The left side of the page will show the chatbot for natural language commands (e.g., "add going to gym as a task"), and the right side will display the to-do list, updating in real-time based on AI responses. The app will be free to build and deploy, using open-source tools and free services.

**Key Features**

- Chatbot interprets user commands and responds in natural language.
- To-do list updates automatically based on AI actions (add, edit, delete, mark complete, etc.).
- User authentication ensures private task lists per user.

**Unexpected Detail**  
 AI's response needs to include both a human-readable message and a machine-readable JSON action for the server to process, ensuring seamless updates to the database.
