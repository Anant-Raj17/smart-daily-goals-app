### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up the Project**

   - Create a new Next.js project with Typescript.
   - Install Shadcn UI for UI components (responsive, accessible, built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS).
   - Configure Firebase for authentication and Firestore database setup.

2. **Implement User Authentication**

   - Use Firebase Authentication for login (email/password, Google, etc.).
   - Store the user's unique ID (UID) for data association.

3. **Set Up the Database**

   - Use Firestore to store to-do lists: each user has a document with a `todo_list` array (tasks with ID, description, and status).
   - Create server-side functions to manage tasks (add, edit, delete, fetch).

4. **Build the Chatbot Interface**

   - Front-end: Design a chatbot with an input field and conversation history display using Shadcn components.
   - Server: When a user sends a message, fetch their current to-do list, create a prompt for Groq's API, and process the response.
   - The AI's response should include a natural language message (e.g., "Added task") and a JSON action (e.g., `{"action": "add_task", "task": "go to gym"}`).
   - Update Firestore based on the JSON action and return both the AI response and updated to-do list to the front-end.

5. **Display and Update the To-Do List**

   - Front-end: Use Shadcn components to show the to-do list (e.g., list of tasks with description and status, like "Go to gym (pending)").
   - Fetch the list on login and refresh after each chatbot interaction, ensuring real-time updates.

6. **Deploy on Vercel**
   - Configure your Next.js project for Vercel deployment, ensuring Firebase and Groq API keys are set as environment variables for security.
